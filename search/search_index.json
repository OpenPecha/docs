Digital text is quickly becoming essential to modern daily life. The article you\u2019re reading right now is born digital; unlike texts of the not-so-distant past, it may never be printed at all. Worldwide, the trend is clear: Digital text is on the way in, and print is on its way out. Year-by-year, more and more readers are turning to ebooks, internet news, and other forms of ereading, while generation-by-generation, print is becoming less and less relevant. These trends aren\u2019t unique to English\u2014to meet the demands and expectations of today\u2019s readers, Tibetan texts, too, are being digitized by many organizations and institutions with a shared appreciation for the Tibetan literary heritage. They include a variety of secular publishers, monastic institutions, and Buddhist foundations, among others. But while these organizations share common goals for common texts, their work is all too frequently completely disconnected from the community at large. This situation negatively impacts what is already a minoritized and under-resourced language. While competition\u2014from other languages, as well as other publishers in the Tibetan etext world\u2014has been a driver of innovation in the adoption of ereading technology, we believe that a rich, shared data source is not only in everyone\u2019s best interest, but the only practical way forward when we consider the time, effort, expertise, and money that quality digitization takes. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve designed OpenPecha to be a public, open platform for collaborative etext curation and annotation sharing. Its aim is providing a wide range of users with the latest version of the exact \u201cview\u201d of any text they need, while maintaining the integrity of the text and its annotations, and simultaneously allowing for community improvements and additions. In this paper, we explore the details of how the project came to be; what it is and how it works; while also presenting a few common use cases. What is OpenPecha As we\u2019ve touched on above, a truly modern digital publication is never a \u201cfinal\u201d, static image. Instead, it\u2019s a living, breathing entity in constant communication with its community. The Tibetan digital landscape needs an open space where data can be gathered; on offer to anyone in the community; and open to collaborative curation and annotation, while also responding to users\u2019 needs. This kind of public-domain, digital publishing will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s heard of Project Gutenburg and its Distributed Proofreaders platform, and the offshoots they\u2019ve inspired (GITenberg, WikiBooks, etc.). From a practical standpoint, that means we need a tool that imports from, and exports to, formats common to users who access Tibetan texts; that transfers annotations from one base text to another; and that offers an organized, systematic catalog of titles, versions, annotations, and related texts. This data-first maintenance and interoperability are the core aims of OpenPecha\u2019s database, format, and toolkit. First, it aims to store every available electronic representation of each text, along with all existing annotations. From there, both the texts and their annotations are downloadable; contributions are uploadable; and users can export to a variety of common formats (like EPUB and PDF). This means that texts can keep improving while not losing any of their annotations. It also allows for any NLP (Natural Language Processing), NER (Named Entity Recognition), or error-detecting models to be applied to the entirety of the corpus without interfering with existing data created by others. Finally, it gives the community of readers access to the most-current proofread ebooks that contain only the annotation layers they need, in the format of their choice. In short, the goal is to provide something that is: Flexible in application, serving a wide variety of Tibetan language professionals; Durable in that it uses free tools and platforms, with minimal maintenance; Editable at all stages of the workflow, and at every level of the document; Easy-to-learn and human-friendly for the average user; Open to anyone anywhere, providing a large catalog of texts with a wide range of annotation schema; and Collaborative , to leverage shared knowledge in a small, specialized field, and allow for crowdsourced improvements.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#why-openpecha","text":"Digital text is quickly becoming essential to modern daily life.
